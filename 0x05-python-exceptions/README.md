# 0x05. Python - Exceptions

Welcome to the 0x05-python-exceptions project repository! This repository contains Python programs that focus on handling exceptions and errors in the Python programming language.

## Description

The 0x05-python-exceptions project explores the concept of exceptions and error handling in Python. Exceptions are unexpected events that can occur during program execution, and Python provides mechanisms for handling and managing these exceptions gracefully.

In this project, you will learn how to:

- Raise and catch exceptions using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks.
- Handle specific types of exceptions.
- Create custom exceptions to suit your program's needs.
- Properly clean up resources using exception handling.
- Understand common exceptions and their meanings.
- Implement robust error handling in Python programs.

Exception handling is a critical aspect of writing reliable and maintainable Python code. By mastering this concept, you can improve the robustness and resilience of your programs.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects included in this repository:

- [0-safe_print_list.py](./0-safe_print_list.py/): A Python function that prints elements from a list and handles exceptions gracefully.
- [1-safe_print_integer.py](./1-safe_print_integer.py/): A Python function that prints an integer and handles exceptions.
- [2-safe_print_list_integers.py](./2-safe_print_list_integers.py/): A Python function that prints only integers from a list, handling exceptions.
- [3-safe_print_division.py](./3-safe_print_division.py/): A Python function that divides two numbers and handles division by zero.
- [4-list_division.py](./4-list_division.py/): A Python function that divides elements of two lists and handles exceptions.
- [5-raise_exception.py](./5-raise_exception.py/): A Python function that raises a type exception.
- [6-raise_exception_msg.py](./6-raise_exception_msg.py/): A Python function that raises a name exception with a custom message.
- [100-safe_print_integer_err.py](./100-safe_print_integer_err.py/): A Python function that prints an integer and handles exceptions while printing an error message to stderr.
- [101-safe_function.py](./101-safe_function.py/): A Python function decorator that adds exception handling to any function.
- [102-magic_calculation.py](./102-magic_calculation.py/): A Python script containing a magic calculation function.

Feel free to explore each project, read the README file, and work on the exercises in any order you prefer. Ensure that you understand the problem statement, implement the necessary code or scripts, and test your solutions for correctness.
