## Description

High-level programming languages are designed to be more user-friendly and human-readable compared to low-level languages like C or assembly. They allow developers to write code that is closer to natural language, making it easier to express complex ideas and solve problems efficiently.

The ALX Higher-Level Programming repository covers a wide range of topics and projects related to high-level programming. Whether you're a beginner looking to get started with Python or an experienced developer exploring JavaScript frameworks, you'll find valuable resources here.

## Languages

This repository covers various high-level programming languages, including but not limited to:

- **Python**: A versatile and widely-used language known for its simplicity and readability.
- **JavaScript**: A powerful language commonly used for web development, known for its versatility and ability to create interactive web pages.

N.B: This is not up to date now as I'll be updating it as I progress in the program

You can explore projects and resources for each of these languages in this repository.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects and topics covered in this repository:

- **Python Basics**: Introduction to Python syntax, data types, and control structures.
- **JavaScript Fundamentals**: Basics of JavaScript, including variables, functions, and control flow.
