## Description

The 0x04-python-more_data_structures project aims to deepen your understanding of advanced data structures and how to use them effectively in Python. In this project, you will explore various data structures beyond basic lists and dictionaries, enabling you to solve more complex problems and write efficient Python code.

Here are some key topics and concepts covered in this project:

- Sets: Understanding sets, their properties, and how to perform set operations.
- Dictionary comprehension: Creating dictionaries using concise and expressive syntax.
- Lambda functions: Defining anonymous functions for specific use cases.
- Usage of map(), reduce(), and filter(): Applying functional programming techniques to manipulate data.
- Sorting data: Implementing custom sorting functions and using built-in sorting methods.
- Set comprehension: Constructing sets using comprehensions.
- Working with iterable data structures: Lists, tuples, and more.

These exercises will help you become proficient in utilizing advanced data structures and functional programming techniques to write cleaner and more efficient Python code.
